This is billy. he is conflicted to flip the table. he stares endlessly into the table's polished wood, admiring its sleek design. billy was kicked off an important project today for force-pushing a commit and losing the team their code. he gazes upon the earth in wonderment. in an instant, a rush of emotions overwhelm him and he grabs onto the edges of the table. As he is about to flip the table in a fit of rage, he looks at the floor surrounding him, he stops, he thinks. "Someone stayed and worked on this table for hours on end, should my rage really be its undoing?"
